GitHub may display the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) in this repository as “Invalid Notebook” or fail to render the code and outputs properly.
This issue can occur due to file size limitations, metadata inconsistencies, or compatibility differences between Jupyter versions.

To view the notebook correctly, please download the .ipynb file and open it locally using:
- Jupyter Notebook
- JupyterLab
- VS Code (with Jupyter extension)

Thank you for your understanding.
